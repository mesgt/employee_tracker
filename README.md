# Application Details

## Purpose

CrimeAde is a mobile-friendly app that allows a user to be more aware of the crimes around them. Our goal is to help users be safe by becoming more informed. 

## Description

This application utilizes node, inquirer and MySQL to create a user-friendly interface to manage employees by department, roles and employee names. With this application, the user is able to create various departments, assign specific roles to these departments and enter employee information in association with a specific department and role. The user is also able to view all departments, roles and employees in a table displayed in the terminal. The user is simply asked a series of questions and based on the response, the terminal runs the command.
